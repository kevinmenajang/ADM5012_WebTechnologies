    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Kevin Menajang. I am an international student from Indonesia. I am currently doing a Masters of Digital Media at Victoria University Melbourne.</p> 
    <p>My hobbies are photography, videography, camera drone, cycling, running, football, badminton, tennis, guitar, piano, drum, bass, music, travelling, gaming, movies, concerts and motorsports like the Formula 1 Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>On this page, I would like to share my experience during the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix in Albert Park, Melbourne. The racing event was held 4 days from Thursday 21st of March until Sunday 24th of March. I went there on the first day and the second day of the event. It was such an amazing experience for me because all this time I could only watch the race from the TV or online streaming platforms back in my home country in Indonesia.</p>
    <p>Here are some pictures that I took from the event:</p>

    <p>That is all that I want to show. Thank you for visiting my website, Have a great day!</p>
